# Streamerdle

Streamerdle is a fun and challenging game where players guess the identity of influencers based on various clues. Developed by Furkan Ergüldürenler using React, this project offers two engaging game modes: Splash and Classic.

## Splash Mode

In Splash mode, players are presented with a blurred image of an influencer. As they guess, sections of the image become unblurred to provide hints. The objective is to correctly identify the influencer before the entire image is revealed.

## Classic Mode

Classic mode is akin to Wordle but with a twist tailored to influencers. Players guess the identity of the influencer based on attributes such as subscriber count, birth year, and content category. Each attribute corresponds to a key, and players receive feedback in the form of colored fields—red for incorrect guesses, green for correct guesses, and orange for partially correct guesses.
